Here’s a fun fact about planes: they’re pretty cheap. Way back in the beginning of commercial aviation, flight was new and classy and luxurious, as much an experience as a mode of transit. It was a novelty. Sure, it’s a technological marvel, but so were cars and trains. Both of these became mundane with time and scale, and aviation fell to the same fate. More people started flying, and it went from a wealthy curiosity to an affordable transportation system. When aviation became an industry, it adopted the economics of industries, and airline design became an economic challenge. Between the surprisingly tight business margins, the insane amount of money put into R&D, and the unpredictability of demand, it is a stressful job to balance the books for an airline. 

Nowadays, planes are cheap transit. Combine those margins with external factors like geopolitically restricted flight route options, real world effects like the 2020s pandemics and the oil crises of the 1970s and 2030s, and the difficult transition to biofuels over petroleum, and it turns into a business of nickels and dimes. These days, planes are basically buses with wings, and that’s not as much of an exaggeration as you may hope. Manufacture cost per seat for planes has dropped year after year, actually approaching that of city buses. They’re cheap. It’s quantitatively provable. I’ve been saying it for years.

“Could you get to your point, please?” asks Rory.

“My point is, we’re polishing shit here. This plane was barely flyable out of the factory, and it’s only worse now,” I answer.

Rory McBrannaugh, the repair lead for Platinum Air’s southeast division, sits in the cockpit of an aging, out-of-service Airbus 519s beside me, leaning on his elbow, tired from the workday and the lecture.

“I’ve been working in passenger airline manufacture and maintenance for longer than you’ve been alive, and you just lectured me for twenty minutes just to say that you think planes are shit?”

“I’m saying they’re _manufactured_ like shit. Especially this one. It’s time to decommission it.”

He sighs. “I want to avoid that if at all possible. The company’s already up my ass about getting it back in service.”

“Of course they are, but this plane is unsafe. If for nothing else, we should keep it down until we can replace its cabin seals.”

“Cabin seals? That’s what you’re worried about?”

“Yes.


Mr. Kinsen’s tie is crooked. The knot sits to the left of his jowl, not even remotely triangular, like he tied it by trial and error. It’s an awful mustard yellow, completely textureless except for a few small grease stains and crumbs from his lunch. The color doesn’t do his splotchy, old skin any favors, and the greasy lunch probably doesn’t, either. He breathes heavily while he talks, as though he’s exhausted from his long day of sitting behind a desk doing fuck-all.

“Aaron, I brought you in to let you know that Platinum Air is getting ready to restructure. We’ll be selling a good portion of the fleet. The company’s turning its focus to subsidized short-haul flights, so it’s selling most of its trans-oceanic and ballistic jets to recoup debts,” he drones in his slow, dry, smoker’s voice.

“I thought there weren’t any air flight subsidies anymore,” I ask. The United States government is, big surprise, also strapped for cash, just like everyone else. More so than usual, even.  The only industries that are really showing meaningful growth are experiencial tourism for the wealthy, and most of that is driven by space-tourism. Moon colony vacations, guided EVAs, hyperbolic space-jet flights. Therefore, the government is “stimulating the economy” by subsidizing these services, at the cost of things like public transit. If that sounds like a bullshit trickle-down excuse, then you’re right.

“There aren’t many, but there are some. We have a few already that we’re trying to hold on to, and we hope to see more get approved after last year’s downturn.”

“Okay, sure,” I say. It’s probably the smartest move they can make. Plat’s been floundering for years. That’s why it was so easy to get a job here. I figured I’d ride the ship down, just do good enough work to be one of the last to go. A dying company’s not an ideal place to be, but there’s so little work available that this is as good a plan as anything. Luckily, my work’s been strong enough in the last six months that I don’t have anything to worry about. There’s still time before the layoffs hit.

Mr. Kinsen clears his throat. “Well, uh, this whole restructuring plan is also going to involve some changes to staff, of course.”

Ah, shit.

“With fewer long-haul planes in the fleet, the company’s laying off much of its mechanic and repair staff.”

“Much of the staff? Not all?”

“We’ll have a small team at our hub in Cincinnati, but that’s about it.”

He pauses, waiting for me to ask more questions.

“Aaron, I’m sorry to tell you that we’re letting you go.”

There it is. I wait again, not giving him a reaction. This sucks. It’s not unexpected, not even unreasonable, to be honest. But, still, he’s firing me. Even if it is just business, fuck him.

“Aaron?” he asks, confused.

“I heard you,” I say flatly.

“Oh. Um, okay then.” He gathers his thoughts for a second. “We just posted the shift schedule for the next two weeks. We have a bit of a busy slate for the next couple days, but after that, we’ll have you work on finishing up any long-term projects and preparing the workshop to be dismantled. You’ll work through that, and your last day will be the end of the next pay period. We’ll need uniforms and keycards back after your last shift.”

“No, that’s okay,” I answer back.

“What do you mean?”

“I’ll just head out today.” I stand up, put on my coat.

“But- hey! Wait, you can’t go today! What about the repair rotation?” Mr. Kinsen sputters.

“Get it covered.”

“Aaron, you’re leaving us short! We’ve still got a full slate---”

I laugh. “You fire me and then you complain that you’re short-staffed? No, man, I’m out. Fuck this place.”

Mr. Kinsen flounders for a moment, then starts dialing someone on his phone. Right before I walk out the door, I turn around.

“Hey, Mr. Kinsen?”

He looks at me, angry and confused.

“You’re a lazy, incompetent piece of shit.” I smile at him.

“Aaron, what-“ he starts, but I shut the door calmly behind me and leave before he can get his last word in.


I wasn’t looking to try and find a new job right now. It’s just about the worst time to be unemployed. Granted, that’s what I said a year ago before I landed Plat, but now it’s even worse. Unprecedented unemployment, rapid economic inflation, wages no one can live on, all the classics. Every year it gets worse, and every year it’s someone else’s fault. People spend more time blaming than they do fixing the issue.

The only way I’ve been able to get by is, well, to be honest, lying. That sounds bad, but it could be worse. Everyone lies on job applications. It’s impossible not to. There’s not really any such thing as an “entry-level” job anymore. Every job wants at least five years experience, strictly relevant, or your application won’t even be read. There’s nowhere to get that experience, of course, because every job has that requirement, but they still demand it anyway. You need to already be in your career to get into your career. No one wants to train people anymore. You’re expected to be fully ready to go on day one. It’s a fucked-up system, and the worst part is that it’s way too entrenched for anyone to do anything. Once one company relaxes their requirements, they’re flooded with more applications than they can handle, or they worry they’ll get subpar employees.

So, you lie. You creatively embellish. You spin things. You find ways to make your real experience as appealing as it can be, and you make up the rest. It’s bullshit for jobs to expect us to meet their expectations, so, the way I see it, it’s fair to bullshit them right back. You make up fake experience, study up so you know just enough jargon and basic concepts to get by, and hope they won’t call you on your bluff. Or, you hire fake references. You can call in favors from friends with good corporate titles to vouch that you’ve worked for them and you’re organized and good under pressure or whatever. If you don’t have any friends like that, you can find new friends that can help, or you can pay someone off at a company that would look good.
