# Gofer: a novel by Ryan Mayers

The year is 2063, and all anyone cares about is Mars expeditions. Once a topic to be written in the history books, it's become accessible by the rich and treated like a cruise excursion. You can go and "colonize Mars" without doing any real work. Everything is taken care of for you, from the construction and preparation to the meal prep. You don't even need to be awake for the voyage. That's all the job of the stewards.

Aaron is a bright but abrasive young man with a talent for lying on his resume and still succeeding at his job. When he's laid off from his position as an airplane mechanic (which he was wildly underqualified for), he once again searches for work, but, this time, he really can't find anything. On a whim, he applies to be a gofer, the lowest-ranked of the stewards on a Mars expedition. He gets the job, but realizes he may have been ambitious with what he could try to fake. Can he keep four other stewards fooled, and 176 passengers alive, on the four-month voyage to Mars?
