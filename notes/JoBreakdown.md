# Jo Walton

*29 • Caretaker - Fixer*

## Role in Story

Secondary character. Conflicts with [Aaron](app://obsidian.md/Aaron), annoyed by other caretakers for not being as committed to the cause as her. Last Caretaker alive besides [Aaron](app://obsidian.md/Aaron), dies in an argument with him.

## Goal

Wants to serve the mission of interplanetary humanity, support the mission, and help contribute to the Expedition company’s ideals.

## Physical Description

Female. Fit and muscular, shaved head.

## Personality

Chronically pissed, quick to judge and hate others when they disagree with her. She considers herself an excellent judge of character and has difficulty moving past first impressions. Defensive and quick to call out that which offends her.

## Occupation

Ship Caretaker for Expedition, Fixer position.

## Habits/Mannerisms

Inserts self into conversations by force. Calls people out publicly and mercilessly. Tries too hard to be in charge even when she’s definitely not and especially when she is. Expects the same commitment and spirit from others as she has herself.

## Background

Has been fascinated by space travel since she was a child. Background in engineering and mechanics, always aiming to work with a company like Expedition. Had lots of options, but chose to work as a Caretaker because that was the most direct way she could help the cause, in her opinion. Wasn’t selected for the leadership position due to psychological evaluations and profiling putting her in the fixer role.

## Internal Conflicts

Jo is under extreme self-imposed pressure to be a perfect example of her ideals and contribute the maximum possible benefit to her cause, and therefore criticizes every missed opportunity or perceived failure with unhealthy scrutiny. She also looks at others through this lens, making her very critical of others. She has competing mentalities that say she is both a failure and a fraud, and that she’s better than everyone else and tries harder than anyone else.

## External Conflicts

She criticizes everyone else for being less committed to the cause than her, and, in general, for being less perfectionist than her. She’s the “get off your asses” member of the team, and is very good at her job as a Fixer, but still doesn’t get respect because she’s seen as too much of a cheerleader for the Expedition group and a general asshole.

## Notes

Dies in conflict with [Aaron](app://obsidian.md/Aaron) toward end of act 2.
